# Kidney Exchange Program


## What is living donor kidney exchange problem?

Let's say a person wants to donate his/her kidney to a loved one but cannot do so because they have some medical incompatibility. This problem can be solved by curating similar patients and swapping the kidney within themselves. This problem is called the living donor kidney exchange problem, and in most places of India, doctors solve it manually. 

## Aim

This project aims to automate a part of this process. This project's primary focus is to provide a platform to facilitate automized inter-hospital kidney transplants.

## Features

This platform allows interested hospitals to register. The doctors from the registered hospitals can create their account and add their patients' (having kidney problems) medical details to this platform.

After a doctor completes this process, this platform provides two main features. The first feature is an option to view only the essential details of a patient required for a kidney transplant. Second, for a given patient, all suitable matches from all the registered hospitals are displayed. These suitable matches are ranked from best to worst.

## How to run the server

1. Install Docker
2. Run `docker-compose up` inside the project root folder

Done! Now you should be able to access the project at **0.0.0.0:8080** or **localhost:8080**. And you should just refresh the page to see your changes.
